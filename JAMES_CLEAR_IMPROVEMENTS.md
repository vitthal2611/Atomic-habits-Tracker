## ✅ Critical Missing Pieces - NOW IMPLEMENTED

### 1. The Plateau of Latent Potential ⭐
**Component**: `PlateauVisualization.js`

**What It Does**:
- Visualizes the "Valley of Disappointment" (days 10-21)
- Shows expected vs. actual progress curve
- Provides contextual encouragement based on progress
- Explains why habits feel useless before breakthrough

**Why It Matters**:
Most people quit in the valley. This visualization helps users understand that delayed results are normal and breakthrough is coming.

### 2. Comprehensive Habit Scorecard ⭐
**Enhancement**: Enhanced in `UnifiedApp.tsx`

**What It Does**:
- Lists 12+ common daily habits
- Allows custom habit additions
- Rates habits as Good (++), Neutral (=), or Bad (--)
- Shows statistics of good vs. bad habits
- Required before accessing main app

**Why It Matters**:
"Awareness comes before change." Users can't improve habits they don't notice. This creates the foundation for intentional habit building.

**Location**: First-time onboarding (required)

---

### 3. Weekly Review & Reflection System ⭐
**Component**: `WeeklyReview.js`

**What It Does**:
- Prompts weekly reflection after 7 days
- Three key questions:
  - What went well?
  - What didn't work?
  - What will you adjust?
- Tracks completion rates
- Stores past reviews for reference

**Why It Matters**:
Systems improve through iteration. Regular reflection ensures continuous optimization of habit systems.

### 4. Environment Design Framework ⭐
**Component**: `EnvironmentDesign.js`

**What It Does**:
- Four principles with examples:
  - Make good habits obvious (visual cues)
  - Make bad habits invisible (remove triggers)
  - Make good habits easy (reduce friction)
  - Make bad habits hard (increase friction)
- Habit-specific environment planning
- Actionable implementation guides

**Why It Matters**:
"Environment is the invisible hand that shapes behavior." This emphasizes that willpower is overrated - environment design is key.

### 5. The Goldilocks Rule ⭐
**Component**: `GoldilocksRule.js`

**What It Does**:
- Analyzes each habit's completion rate
- Identifies habits that are:
  - Too easy (>90% completion - boring)
  - Just right (70-80% - optimal)
  - Too hard (<40% - overwhelming)
- Provides specific recommendations
- Suggests scaling up or returning to 2-minute version

**Why It Matters**:
"Habits are most engaging when at the edge of your abilities." This prevents boredom and burnout.

### 6. Temptation Bundling ⭐
**Component**: `TemptationBundling.js`

**What It Does**:
- Links habits you NEED with activities you WANT
- Creates "Only X while Y" rules
- Provides examples (Netflix while exercising)
- Saves and tracks bundles

**Why It Matters**:
Makes hard habits attractive by pairing them with enjoyable activities. Increases adherence through positive association.

### 7. Habit Contracts & Commitment Devices ⭐
**Component**: `HabitContract.js`

**What It Does**:
- Creates formal commitment contracts
- Defines consequences for failure
- Optional accountability partner
- Email notification capability
- Signed and dated contracts

**Why It Matters**:
Social pressure and consequences create accountability. Public commitments are harder to break.

### 8. Enhanced Habit Stacking ⭐
**Enhancement**: Updated `AddHabit.js`

**What It Does**:
- Prominently highlights habit stacking option
- Visual emphasis with blue highlight
- Explains benefits in-form

**Why It Matters**:
"The current habit acts as a cue for the new one." Stacking is one of the most effective habit-building strategies.

### 9. Visual Cue Emphasis ⭐
**Enhancement**: Updated `AddHabit.js`

**What It Does**:
- Makes visual cue field required (not optional)
- Green highlight for emphasis
